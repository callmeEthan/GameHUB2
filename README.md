# GameHUB Launcher 2
A game launcher interface for PC, a worthy successor to GameHUB 1.5  
This skin is an entirely different version from 1.5 and is written from scratch, it's not backward compatible and neither optimized, in fact it's probably even more performance hungry, **using latest version of rainmeter beta with Hardware acceleration is highly recommended.**  

## What's new?
* Provide more control to gamepad.
* This skin would include most of the functionality is previous version, while including new feature, new interface.  
* Now working as a dynamic system, allowing multiple layout, list and app in a single skin.  

## Dynamic system
* In 1.5 gamehub provide a charming game launcher with dynamic list, allow showing as much game/app as you want with friendly configuration interface. Now GameHUB 2 aim to give even more.
* GameHUB 2 can show multiple list simultaneously (lag may vary), lists layout and configuration are loaded from a single file, each list can show it's own indivitual set of app, gamehub is no longer limitted to app and game and you can swap between layout easily.
