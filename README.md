# GameHUB Launcher 2
A game launcher interface for PC, a worthy successor to GameHUB. 
This skin is an entirely different version from 1.5 and is written from scratch, it's not backward compatible and neither optimized, **using latest version of rainmeter beta with Hardware acceleration is highly recommended.**  

## Update 6
You can now upscale image by adding ImageScale and ImageShift in your layout file (under [Display] section)  
note that ImageScale=0.5 will increase image size by twice and ImageScale=2 will reduce it by half  
ImageShift change how much the image "scroll" when you scroll the list, ImageShift=0 will stop image from scrolling.  
You can now add animated image in launch circle. Template image are in @Resources\Gif folder, inside list.inc file add Gif#=<Gif folder name>  
* Example Gif1=KonekoRight  
Other entry without gif value defined will launch as normal  
To create gif image, follow [this skin](https://www.deviantart.com/therunningjoke/art/Rainmeter-Anime-Gif-Picture-4-0-581408520) instruction.  

## What's new?
* Provide more control to gamepad.
* This skin would include most of the functionality in previous version, while including new feature and interface.  
* Now working as a dynamic system, allowing multiple layout, list and app in a single skin.  
* Include movie thumbnailer, fetch video list from a directory and generate list with video thumbnail.

## Dynamic system
* GameHUB 2 can show multiple list simultaneously (lag may vary), lists layout and configuration are loaded from a single file, each list can show it's own indivitual set of app and you can swap between layout easily.
